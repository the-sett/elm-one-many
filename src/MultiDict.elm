module MultiDict exposing (MultiDict, insert, remove, get, empty)

{-| MultiDict implements a one-to-many relationship, between `comparable` keys
and `Set`s of values. Each key may be associated with zero or many values, compared
with a `Dict` which associated each key with just one value. Its implementation is
a `Dict` of `Set`s, but the overhead of creating new sets or removing empty sets as
values are added to or removed from the data structyre is managed for you.
